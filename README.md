# ToolSuite 
This document describes a custom Application built around semiconductor yield analyst workflows.  The tool was quite popular and evolved to service many additional user personas, both technical and non-technical.  

This custom application took advantage of an existing data pipeline that was created for other use case specific, expert user software platforms. The pipeline was enriched and API's were implemented that leveraged the embedded capabilities of these expert systems to implement machine learning results wrapped in a context that fit the natural workflows of users. This proved to be immensely popular as users no longer needed to learn very complicated expert systems to perform analyses. 

The capabilities of this tool have been disclosed with the approval of LSI Logic in more than one publication.
